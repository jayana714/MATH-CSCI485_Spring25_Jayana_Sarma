# Wine Quality Dimensionality Reduction

This project demonstrates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-SNE** on the Wine Quality dataset to reduce its dimensionality for easier visualization and analysis.

## Usage

1. Download the datasets.
2. Ensure the following CSV files are present:
   - `winequality-red.csv` (Red Wine dataset)
   - `winequality-white.csv` (White Wine dataset)

## Dataset

The dataset includes chemical properties of red and white wines, such as:
- Acidity
- Alcohol content
- Quality (target variable)

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

- PCA is a **linear** technique that reduces dimensionality by projecting the data onto the axes (principal components) that capture the maximum variance.
- PCA is computationally fast, easy to interpret, and works well for datasets with linear relationships between features.
- It provides a global understanding of the data by maximizing variance but may not capture complex, non-linear relationships.

### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

- t-SNE is a **non-linear** technique that focuses on preserving the **local structure** of the data.
- It is commonly used for visualizing high-dimensional datasets, particularly for uncovering clusters.
- t-SNE can provide better separation between clusters compared to PCA but may distort the global relationships (distances between clusters).
- It is computationally expensive and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters like perplexity and learning rate.

## Comparison of PCA and t-SNE

- **PCA** is faster, easier to interpret, and focuses on capturing global variance, making it suitable for datasets with linear relationships.
- **t-SNE** is better for visualizing complex datasets with a lot of non-linear relationships and is more effective at identifying clusters.
- While PCA provides a good understanding of the data's overall structure, t-SNE is useful for exploring local patterns and cluster formation.

## Conclusion

This project compares the strengths and limitations of PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. While PCA is useful for linear data and provides a global view of the dataset, t-SNE is better suited for uncovering complex structures and clusters in high-dimensional data.
